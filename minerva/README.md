# MINERVA: Meandering In Networks of Entities to Reach Verisimilar Answers

This repository contains both the original TensorFlow implementation and our new PyTorch implementation of MINERVA, a reinforcement learning agent for knowledge graph reasoning. MINERVA learns to navigate knowledge graphs by taking a sequence of relation-following steps to answer queries.

## How MINERVA Works

### 1. Knowledge Graph Query Answering

MINERVA addresses the task of answering queries on incomplete knowledge graphs. Given a query like (Colin Kaepernick, PLAYERHOMESTADIUM, ?), the agent learns to walk through the knowledge graph to find the answer entity.

Unlike traditional embedding-based methods, MINERVA:
- Provides interpretable reasoning paths
- Can leverage the graph structure during inference
- Handles incomplete knowledge graphs naturally
- Works with sparse graphs where embedding methods struggle

### 2. Agent-Environment System

- **State**: Current entity and query relation embeddings
- **Actions**: Selecting which outgoing edge (relation-entity pair) to follow
- **Environment**: The knowledge graph with allowed transitions
- **Reward**: +1 for reaching correct answer, 0 otherwise

### 3. Learning Process

1. **Policy Network**: LSTM-based network that maintains history of the walk
2. **Training**: REINFORCE algorithm with entropy regularization
3. **Inference**: Beam search to maintain multiple hypothesis paths
4. **Evaluation**: Hits@k and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

### 4. Key Innovations

- **No Precomputed Paths**: Unlike DeepPath, MINERVA learns online
- **History-Dependent Policy**: LSTM maintains memory of previous steps
- **Beam Search**: Explores multiple paths during inference
- **Entropy Regularization**: Encourages exploration during training

## Algorithm Deep Dive: How MINERVA Works

### The Core Idea

MINERVA treats knowledge graph reasoning as a sequential decision-making problem. Given a query like (Barack Obama, PRESIDENTOF, ?), the agent learns to navigate through the graph by following relations to reach the correct answer entity (USA).

Think of it as a game where:
- You start at entity "Barack Obama"
- You can only see the immediate neighbors (connected entities)
- You must choose which relation to follow (e.g., BORNIN → Hawaii, PRESIDENTOF → USA)
- You get a reward (+1) only if you reach the correct answer

### The MINERVA Algorithm

#### 1. Problem Formulation

**Input**: Knowledge Graph (KG) and Query (e_source, r_query, ?)
- KG: Set of triples (entity1, relation, entity2)
- Query: Find e_target given e_source and r_query

**Output**: Path from e_source to e_target through the KG

#### 2. Markov Decision Process (MDP)

MINERVA formulates KG reasoning as an MDP:

- **State s_t = (e_t, h_t)**
  - e_t: Current entity at step t
  - h_t: History embedding from LSTM (captures path taken so far)

- **Action a_t = (r, e)**
  - Choose relation r and destination entity e from available edges
  - Actions are constrained by KG structure (can only follow existing edges)

- **Transition**: Deterministic - taking action (r, e) moves agent to entity e

- **Reward**: Binary sparse reward
  - r_T = +1 if final entity e_T equals target entity
  - r_T = 0 otherwise

#### 3. Policy Network Architecture

The policy network π(a_t|s_t) consists of:

```
1. History Encoding (LSTM):
   h_t = LSTM(h_{t-1}, [e_{t-1}, r_{t-1}])
   
2. Action Encoding:
   a = [r_embed; e_embed]  # Concatenate relation and entity embeddings
   
3. Policy MLP:
   score(a) = MLP([h_t; r_query; a])
   
4. Action Distribution:
   π(a|s) = softmax(scores) with invalid actions masked to -∞
```

#### 4. Training with REINFORCE

MINERVA uses REINFORCE with a baseline for variance reduction:

```
1. Rollout Generation:
   - Start at source entity
   - Sample T actions from policy
   - Receive final reward r_T

2. Return Calculation:
   G_t = Σ(γ^{t'-t} * r_{t'}) for t' from t to T
   (In practice, γ=1 and only r_T is non-zero)

3. Advantage Estimation:
   A_t = G_t - b(s_t)
   where b(s_t) is a moving average baseline

4. Policy Gradient:
   ∇J = E[Σ_t A_t * ∇log π(a_t|s_t)]

5. Entropy Regularization:
   H = -Σ_a π(a|s) * log π(a|s)
   Loss = -J - β*H  (β decays over time)
```

#### 5. Beam Search Inference

During evaluation, MINERVA uses beam search for better performance:
- Maintain top-k paths at each step
- Expand each path, keep top-k overall
- Pool answers from all paths (max or sum)

#### 1. Agent (model/agent.py)

The policy network implementation:

```python
class Agent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, params):
        # Embeddings
        self.relation_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_relations, 2*embedding_size)
        self.entity_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_entities, 2*embedding_size)
        
        # LSTM for history encoding
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
            input_size=2*embedding_size,  # [r_prev, e_prev]
            hidden_size=hidden_size,
            num_layers=num_layers,
            batch_first=True
        )
        
        # Policy MLP
        self.mlp = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(4*hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, m*embedding_size),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
```

Key methods:
- `get_action_embedding()`: Creates [r_embed; e_embed] for each action
- `policy_mlp()`: Computes scores for all actions
- `action_distribution()`: Applies masking and softmax

#### 2. Environment (model/environment.py)

Manages KG navigation:

```python
class Environment:
    def reset(self, e_source, r_query):
        # Initialize episode
        self.current_entity = e_source
        self.path = [e_source]
        
    def get_valid_actions(self, entity):
        # Return neighboring (relation, entity) pairs
        return self.graph[entity]
        
    def step(self, action):
        # Execute action, update state
        relation, next_entity = action
        self.current_entity = next_entity
        self.path.append(next_entity)
```

#### 3. Trainer (model/trainer.py)

Implements REINFORCE:

```python
class Trainer:
    def train_step(self, batch):
        # 1. Generate rollouts
        for i in range(num_rollouts):
            states, actions, rewards = self.rollout(batch)
            
        # 2. Compute returns (cumulative discounted rewards)
        returns = self.compute_returns(rewards, gamma=1.0)
        
        # 3. Normalize advantages
        advantages = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + 1e-6)
        
        # 4. Policy gradient loss
        log_probs = agent.get_log_probs(states, actions)
        pg_loss = -(advantages * log_probs).mean()
        
        # 5. Entropy regularization
        entropy = agent.compute_entropy(states)
        loss = pg_loss - beta * entropy
        
        # 6. Update baseline
        baseline.update(returns)
```

#### 4. Key Implementation Details

**Action Masking**:
```python
# Mask invalid actions with large negative value
logits[invalid_actions] = -99999.0
probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
```

**Cumulative Rewards**:
```python
# Correct implementation (fixed during development)
returns = torch.zeros_like(rewards)
running_return = 0
for t in reversed(range(path_length)):
    running_return = gamma * running_return + rewards[:, t]
    returns[:, t] = running_return
```

**Beta Decay**:
```python
# Entropy coefficient decays over time
beta_current = beta * (0.90 ** (global_step / 200))
```

**Beam Search**:
```python
# Maintain top-k paths during inference
beam = [(source_entity, initial_state, 1.0)]
for step in range(path_length):
    candidates = []
    for entity, state, prob in beam:
        actions = get_valid_actions(entity)
        action_probs = policy(state, actions)
        for action, action_prob in zip(actions, action_probs):
            candidates.append((
                action.entity,
                update_state(state, action),
                prob * action_prob
            ))
    beam = sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: -x[2])[:beam_size]
```

pip install tensorflow>=2.10.0 numpy tqdm
```

## Datasets

The original implementation includes several preprocessed datasets:

- **Countries S1/S2/S3**: Synthetic datasets for quick testing
- **Kinship**: Family relationship reasoning
- **FB15K-237**: Freebase knowledge base subset
- **WN18RR**: WordNet subset
- **NELL-995**: Never-Ending Language Learning KB
- **Grid Worlds (4x4, 6x6, 8x8, 10x10)**: Navigation problems as knowledge graphs

Datasets are located in `original/datasets/data_preprocessed/`.

## Usage

### PyTorch Implementation

```bash
cd src/

# Train on a dataset (basic usage)
python train.py \
    --data_input_dir ../original/datasets/data_preprocessed/countries_S1 \
    --vocab_dir ../original/datasets/data_preprocessed/countries_S1/vocab \
    --total_iterations 1000

# Use JSON configuration file
python train.py ../configs/countries_s1.json

# Override specific parameters from JSON config
python train.py ../configs/countries_s1.json --total_iterations 2000 --batch_size 256

# Specify device (auto-detects by default)
python train.py ../configs/countries_s1.json --device cuda  # NVIDIA GPU
python train.py ../configs/countries_s1.json --device mps   # Apple Silicon
python train.py ../configs/countries_s1.json --device cpu   # CPU only
```

### TensorFlow Implementation (Modernized)

```bash
cd comparison/

# Train on a dataset
python run_tensorflow.py --dataset countries_S1 --iterations 100

# The implementation has been modernized to work with:
# - TensorFlow 2.x with tf.compat.v1 compatibility layer
# - Keras 3 compatible LSTM wrapper
# - Python 3.8+ compatibility
```

**⚠️ Limitation**: The TensorFlow implementation currently has checkpoint compatibility issues that prevent test phase evaluation. Training and validation evaluation work correctly.

## Comparing Implementations

We provide comprehensive tools to compare implementations:

```bash
cd comparison/

# Compare both implementations on same dataset
python compare.py --dataset countries_S1 --iterations 100

# Compare on multiple datasets
python compare.py --test_multiple  # Tests: countries_S1, S2, S3, kinship, umls
python compare.py --datasets countries_S1 countries_S2 kinship

# Run individual implementations
python run_pytorch.py --dataset kinship --iterations 200
python run_tensorflow.py --dataset kinship --iterations 200
```

**Important Notes**:
- The comparison uses the **tf_patched** version in `comparison/tf_patched/`, which is a modernized version of the original TensorFlow code
- The original code in `original/` requires TensorFlow 1.3 and Python 2.7 and is preserved for reference
- The comparison evaluates **training validation metrics only** due to TensorFlow checkpoint compatibility issues

See `comparison/COMPARISON_GUIDE.md` and `comparison/PARITY_REPORT.md` for detailed analysis.

**Critical Bug Fix:**
During development, we fixed a bug in the cumulative discounted reward calculation:

```python
# Fixed implementation
for t in reversed(range(path_length)):
    running_add = gamma * running_add + cum_disc_reward[:, t]
    cum_disc_reward[:, t] = running_add
```

This ensures proper credit assignment during training.
